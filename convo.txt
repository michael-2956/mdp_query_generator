Task Objective: "Count the total number of orders"

Decision #1

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM [?]

Decision Required: Choose whether to use an alias for the item in the FROM clause. Using an alias allows for subqueries and easier reference within the query. If you plan to use just a table name directly in the FROM clause, an alias isn't necessary as the table can be referenced by its name.

Explanation:
- With an alias: SELECT A1.C1 FROM T1 AS A1. "A1" is the alias, making it easier to reference in complex queries.
- Without an alias: SELECT T1.C1 FROM T1. The table "T1" is directly referenced without an alias.


Options:
    1) WITH an alias
    2) WITHOUT an alias


Response:
I choose option 2) WITHOUT an alias. In this case, since we are only counting the total number of orders without the need for complex queries or subqueries, using an alias is unnecessary. Directly referencing the table name will suffice.

    4) CUSTOMER
    5) ORDERS
    6) LINEITEM

Decision #2

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to JOIN the generated relation with any other one.

Note that a relation is not necessarily a table, it can also, for example, be a subquery.


Options:
    1) JOIN the generated relation
    2) DON'T JOIN the generated relation


Response:
I choose option 2) DON'T JOIN the generated relation. Since the task is to count the total number of orders, there is no need to join the ORDERS table with any other table for this specific query.

Decision #3

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to finish generating the FROM clause or perform a cartesian product with some other relation. For example, if you have:
SELECT  FROM T1
A cartesian product can look like:
SELECT  FROM T1, T2


Options:
    1) Finish generating the FROM clause.
    2) Perform a cartesian product with an another relation.


Response:
I choose option 1) Finish generating the FROM clause. Since the task is to count the total number of orders, there is no need to perform a cartesian product with another relation in this query.
Last line: I choose option 1) Finish generating the FROM clause. Since the task is to count the total number of orders, there is no need to perform a cartesian product with another relation in this query.

Prompt:
ERROR: Invalid option: "I choose option 1) Finish generating the FROM clause. Since the task is to count the total number of orders, there is no need to perform a cartesian product with another relation in this query.".
Valid options are: 1, 2.
The last line of your response should not contain anything but the option number.

Decision #4

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS WHERE [?]

Decision Required: Choose whether to include the WHERE clause in the highlighted query.


Options:
    1) ADD a WHERE clause, allowing for data filtering. Suitable for scenarios requiring specific data subsets before further processing.
    2) SKIP this step.

Decision #5

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS GROUP BY [?]

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to make the highlighted query groupped.

You should choose "DO make the query groupped" if you want to use aggregation in your current query or you want to add a GROUP BY clause.

Write down the answer to this question: Will the current query need to use an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause to satisfy the task description?
If yes, select "DO make the query groupped".


Options:
    1) DO make the query groupped. You will be able to add a SELECT clause later.
    2) DON'T make the query groupped, and ADD the SELECT clause.

Prompt:

Decision #6

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS GROUP BY [?]

Decision Required: You chose to make the query groupped. Now you need to decide whether to include the GROUP BY clause itself.

Write down the answer to this question: Will the current query need to treat all of the rows in a relation as a single group to satisfy the task description? 
For example: `SELECT SUM(C1) FROM T1` is such a query.
If yes, choose to option to "OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group"

However, if you indend to group by a specific column(s), choose to add the GROUP BY clause add this step.


Options:
    1) OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group.
    2) ADD the GROUP BY clause. You won't be able to group by a single group.

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS HAVING [?]

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to add the HAVING clause.


Options:
    1) Add the HAVING clause. You will be able to add a SELECT clause later.
    2) Omit the HAVING clause, and add the SELECT clause

Decision #8

Current SQL Query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to put only distinct rows in the output. This will add the DISTINCT keyword after SELECT.

Decision #9

Current SQL Query: SELECT [?] FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select which kind of expression you would like to place instead of the highlight token in the SELECT clause.


Options:
    1) An expression without alias: [expr]. You won't be able to add an alias later. Aliases improve readability.
    2) An expression with an alias: [expr] AS [alias]


Response:
COUNT(*) as total_orders

Decision #10

Current SQL Query: SELECT [?] AS total_orders FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select the SQL data type of the expression that you want to generate.

To deduce the correct SQL data type, write down what the expression that will replace the highlight token should look like in the end.

After that, answer the question: what is the SQL data type of this expression in PostgreSQL?

Finally, select the data type accordingly.

Note that for COUNT you should select bigint.


Context: This decision affect the expression in the SELECT clause

Options:
    1) bigint
    2) integer
    3) numeric
    4) bool
    5) text
    6) date
    7) timestamp
    8) interval


Response:
The expression that will replace the highlight token should look like COUNT(*) as total_orders.

The SQL data type of this expression in PostgreSQL is bigint.

Therefore, I select option 1) bigint.
Last line: Therefore, I select option 1) bigint.

Prompt:
ERROR: Invalid option: "Therefore, I select option 1) bigint.".
Valid options are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
The last line of your response should not contain anything but the option number.

Decision #11

Current SQL Query: SELECT [?] AS total_orders FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select which kind of expression you would like to replace the current highlight token with.


Options:
    1) A nested expression: ([expr]). This will add parentheses in place of the current highlight token, and you would need to populate them with an expression afterwards.
    3) A typed NULL. This will put null::[type] in place of the current highlight token depending on the type you selected before
    5) A subquery. Select this if you want to put a single column, single row subquery in place of the current highlight token.
    6) An aggregate function. Select this if you want to put an aggregate function in place of the current highlight token.
    7) CASE expression. Select this if you want to put a CASE expression in place of the current highlight token.
    8) A value such as: 1, 'abc', date '01.01.1978', true, etc.
    9) A formula. Select this if you want to put a formila in place of the current highlight token. Examples include '1 + 2 * C1' (for types such as integer), 'l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '90' day' (for bool), etc. (depending on the selected type)

Decision #12

Current SQL Query: SELECT () AS total_orders FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select whether you would like your aggregate function to aggregate only DISTINCT arguments.
Example:
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT C1) FROM T1
Will output 5 if C1 values are 2, 2 and 3.
Note that adding DISTINCT will forbid you from doing COUNT(*), since COUNT(DISTINCT *) is invalid code.


Options:
    1) Skip this step
    2) Add DISTINCT

Decision #13

Current SQL Query: SELECT ([?]) AS total_orders FROM ORDERS

Decision Required: Select whether you would like a single-argument aggregate function, COUNT with an arbitrary expression as an argument, or COUNT(*). Note that the COUNT(*) option would not be an available if you selected to add DISTINCT before.


Options:
    1) A single-argument aggregate function
    2) COUNT([expr])
    3) COUNT(*)

Decision #16

Current SQL Query: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM ORDERS LIMIT [?]

Decision Required: Select whether you would like to add the LIMIT clause.
Note that in some cases the query needs to output only a single row to be valid, so you only would be able to specify LIMIT 1 of any limit at all.


Options:
    1) Don't add the LIMIT clause
    3) Add the LIMIT clause
