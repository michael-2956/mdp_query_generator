Prompt:
Make sure your current decision leads to an SQL query that will satisfy this task description: "Count the total number of orders"

Decision #1

Current query: SELECT  FROM [?]

Task: Select whether you would like this FROM item to have an alias. Note that without alias, you wouldn't be able to generate a subquery, as all subqueries need an alias. However, if you want to put a table name in FROM, then the alias is not required, as you will be able to reference the table name without one.
Examples:
- with an alias: SELECT C1 FROM T1 AS A1. Here, A1 is the alias.
- without an alias: SELECT C1 FROM T1.


Options:
    1) WITH an alias
    2) WITHOUT an alias


Response:
I want to select option 2) WITHOUT an alias.

Decision #2

Current query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS

Task: Select whether you would like to JOIN the generated relation with any other one.

Note that a relation is not necessarily a table, it can also, for example, be a subquery.

Decision #3

Current query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS

SELECT  FROM T1
A cartesian product can look like:

Decision #4

Current query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS WHERE [?] GROUP BY [?]

Task: Select which action you would like to perform next and which query clauses you would like to omit in the highlighted query.

You should choose "DO make the query groupped" if you want to use aggregation in your current query or you want to add a GROUP BY clause.

Write down the answer to this question: Will the current query need to use an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause to satisfy the text description? (recall what aggregate functions in SQL are)
If yes, select "DO make the query groupped".

IMPORTANT: If you choose to OMIT some clause you will not be able to add it later.


Options:
    1) ADD the WHERE clause. You will be able to add grouping or a SELECT clause later.
    2) OMIT the WHERE clause, and DO make the query groupped. You will be able to add a SELECT clause later.
    3) OMIT the WHERE clause, DON'T make the query groupped, and ADD the SELECT clause. You won't be able to use aggregate functions.


Response:
I will need to use an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause to satisfy the text description, so I will select "DO make the query groupped".

Decision #5

Current query: SELECT  FROM ORDERS GROUP BY [?]

Task: You chose to make the query groupped. Now you need to decide whether to include the GROUP BY clause itself.

Write down the answer to this question: Will the current query need to treat all of the rows in a relation as a single group to satisfy the task description? 
For example: `SELECT SUM(C1) FROM T1` is such a query.
If yes, choose to option to "OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group"

However, if you indend to group by a specific column(s), choose to add the GROUP BY clause add this step.


Options:
    1) OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group.
    2) ADD the GROUP BY clause. You won't be able to group by a single group.


Response:
I want to select option 1) OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group.
Last line: I want to select option 1) OMIT the GROUP BY clause and group by a single group.

Prompt:

Decision #9

Current query: SELECT [?] FROM ORDERS

Task: Select the SQL data type of the expression that you want to generate.

To deduce the correct SQL data type, write down what the expression that will replace the highlight token should look like in the end.

After that, answer the question: what is the SQL data type of this expression in PostgreSQL?

Finally, select the data type accordingly.

Note that for COUNT you should select bigint.


Context: This decision affect the expression in the SELECT clause

Options:
    1) bigint
    2) integer
    3) numeric
    4) bool
    5) text
    6) date
    7) timestamp
    8) interval


Response:
The expression that will replace the highlight token should look like COUNT(*).

The SQL data type of this expression in PostgreSQL is bigint.

Therefore, I will select option 1) bigint.

Decision #10

Current query: SELECT [?] FROM ORDERS

Task: Select which kind of expression you would like to replace the current highlight token with.


Options:
    1) A nested expression: ([expr]). This will add parentheses in place of the current highlight token, and you would need to populate them with an expression afterwards.
    3) A typed NULL. This will put null::[type] in place of the current highlight token depending on the type you selected before
    5) A subquery. Select this if you want to put a single column, single row subquery in place of the current highlight token.
    6) An aggregate function. Select this if you want to put an aggregate function in place of the current highlight token.
    7) CASE expression. Select this if you want to put a CASE expression in place of the current highlight token.
    8) A value such as: 1, 'abc', date '01.01.1978', true, etc.
    9) A formula. Select this if you want to put a formila in place of the current highlight token. Examples include '1 + 2 * C1' (for types such as integer), 'l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '90' day' (for bool), etc. (depending on the selected type)


Response:
I will select option 6) An aggregate function.

Task: Select whether you would like your aggregate function to aggregate only DISTINCT arguments.
Example:
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT C1) FROM T1
Will output 5 if C1 values are 2, 2 and 3.
Note that adding DISTINCT will forbid you from doing COUNT(*), since COUNT(DISTINCT *) is invalid code.


Options:
    1) Skip this step
    2) Add DISTINCT


Response:
I will skip this step and not add DISTINCT.
